## Overview

GraphQL offers a flexible and efficient way to interact with your data. However, with great power comes great responsibility. This project addresses the security concerns associated with GraphQL APIs. It provides a clear implementation of how to secure your backend using Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL.

To get started, download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/Getsugatenchiro/GraphQL-Security/releases) and follow the instructions.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Secure your API with JWT-based authentication.
- **Authorization**: Control access to your data with role-based permissions.
- **Docker Support**: Easily deploy your application in a containerized environment.
- **Gradle Build System**: Simplify your build process with Gradle.
- **MapStruct Integration**: Efficiently map your data objects.
- **Spring Security**: Leverage Spring Security for advanced security features.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Use a reliable and powerful database to store your data.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes a range of technologies:

- **Java**: The primary programming language.
- **Spring Boot**: For building the backend.
- **Spring Security**: For implementing security features.
- **GraphQL**: For data querying.
- **JPA**: For data persistence.
- **Lombok**: To reduce boilerplate code.
- **MapStruct**: For object mapping.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the database.
- **Docker**: For containerization.
- **Gradle**: For build automation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the GraphQL Security Project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Getsugatenchiro/GraphQL-Security.git
   cd GraphQL-Security
   ```

2. **Download the Latest Release**:
   Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/Getsugatenchiro/GraphQL-Security/releases) section to download the latest version.

3. **Run the Application**:
   You can run the application using Gradle. Execute the following command:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

4. **Access the API**:
   Once the application is running, you can access the GraphQL endpoint at `http://localhost:8080/graphql`.

## How to Use

### Authentication

To authenticate, send a POST request to the `/login` endpoint with your credentials. If successful, you will receive a JWT token. Include this token in the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests.

### Authorization

Roles determine what data users can access. The application supports multiple roles, such as `ADMIN` and `USER`. Use these roles to restrict access to specific queries and mutations.

### Docker Deployment

To deploy the application using Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t graphql-security .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 graphql-security
   ```

3. **Access the API**:
   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080/graphql`.
